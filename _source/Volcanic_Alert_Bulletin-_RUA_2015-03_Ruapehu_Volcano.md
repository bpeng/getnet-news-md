The level of seismic activity has decreased. “During April we recorded intermittently moderate to strong levels of volcanic tremor at Mt Ruapehu, however since April 28 the level has more than halved” reported volcanologist Brad Scott.

Mt Ruapehu’s Crater Lake has started to cool. The temperature had declined to about 37°C in late April and is now at 34°C. The lake has been in a heating phase which started in late 2014 when the lake was 15°C, reaching a peak of over 40°C in late January–early February 2015 (see RUA 2015/02).
The Crater Lake was sampled on April 24 and no changes are apparent in the chemistry of the lake water. No other changes have been observed at the Crater Lake.

Mt Ruapehu remains at Volcanic Alert Level 1 (minor unrest). 

The Volcanic Alert Level ranges from 0 to 5 and defines the current status at a volcano.
The Aviation Colour Code for Ruapehu is Green. Aviation Colour Codes are based on four colours and are intended for reference only in the international civil aviation community.

GNS Science continues to closely monitor Ruapehu through the GeoNet project. http://www.geonet.org.nz/volcano
